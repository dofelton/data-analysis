# Overview

This project is an opportunity to learn and practice data analytics. I will learn how to use Python and pandas. 

I am analysising a data set obtained from kaggle.com containing data about jobs in the field of data science. The data was gathered one year ago.

I chose this data so that I could get a better idea of what entry jobs there are in data science, where those jobs are based, and the average salary I could expect.

# Data Analysis Results

What are the most common entry level jobs available?
What is the average salary for a data science position and for an entry level postition?
What was the growth of the number of postions available from 2020 to 2023?

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and Kaggle.com. Code was written in Python using pandas.

# Useful Websites

* [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Future Work

* create charts to visually represent the analasis results
* Better understand how to use multiple conditions
* Be able to utilize more than one table
